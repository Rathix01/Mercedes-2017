        <h4>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h4>

        <p>You can request us to cancel your policy at any time, the process depends on the product and when you wish to cancel: If you cancel inside the "free look period" for Volo Lifestyle Cover (the first 30 days of cover), we will cancel your policy from when you first purchased it and you will receive a refund of all premiums paid. From date of receipt of notification of cancellation you will not be entitled to any policy benefits.
        </p>
        <p>If you cancel outside the "free look period" for Volo Lifestyle Cover (after the first 30 days of cover) your policy is cancelled from the date your current paid premiums expire.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the Free Look Period for Volo Lifestyle Cover?</h4>

        <p>Because we sell a non-advice product, which means we don't advise you on what cover to buy, you get a 30 day period (the "Free Look Period") where you are welcome to try out the product and our service and decide if you want to remain a customer. 
        </p>
        <p>This gives you time to read your policy and benefits and ensure that you are comfortable with the cover you are being provided with. 
        </p>
        <h4>What if I fail to make a payment?</h4>

        <p>If you miss a payment, there is a grace period of 30 days to allow you to catch up and make the payment. 
        </p>
        <p>Your payment must have arrived in our account before the 30 days are up, or your account will be cancelled. In this event you can reapply for a new policy but exclusions and any new pricing will apply. 
        </p>
        <p>Policies cannot be reinstated once cancelled.
