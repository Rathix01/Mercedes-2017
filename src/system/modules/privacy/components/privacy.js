        </p>
        <h4>How We Collect Information</h4>

        </p>
        <h4>How we Store Your Information</h4>
        <p>We currently use cloud-based solutions for our information systems, which includes data potentially being stored overseas. All reasonable steps will be taken to keep such information secure (whether in New Zealand or overseas).</p>
        <h4>Disclosing Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
          In order to provide you with our products and services we may need to disclose your information to third parties who assist us with:

        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Claims assessors;</li>
          <li>Our reinsurers;</li>
          <li>Medical practitioners.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There may also be circumstances where we are required to disclose personal information by law, for example to government and regulatory authorities.
        </p>
        <h4> Email and Telephone </h4>
        <p>
          We know the information you provide us with is important to you and we take pride in keeping your personal information safe. Sometimes, however, a particular means of communication is open to abuse by third parties, for example when you email or telephone us. While we will take all reasonable steps to ensure the information you provide us is held securely we cannot, however, guarantee the safety of information while in transit to us (unless it is via a secure channel we provide to you).<br /><br />
          We may record the content of emails or telephone conversations for training, instruction, verification, and administration purposes.
        </p>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>
          We rely on third party data storage providers for the majority of the information we store. We do this only where we believe the third party data storage provider can keep your information safe and secure. Our Lock box data store provides state of the art security. Any information held directly by us either electronic or physical will be held securely.
        </p>
        <h4>We protect you online</h4>
        <p>
          We have taken steps to make sure that you and your computer are safe when visiting our website.
        </p>
        <h4>You can trust our website</h4>
        <p>
          Our website has an SSL security certificate (issued by Thawte) which proves to you that our site is genuine, encrypted, and secure, giving you peace of mind that your personal and financial confidential information is protected.  
        </p>
        <p>
          You can check that our site (and any other website you visit) has been authenticated with a security certificate easily in any internet browser you are using.  Proof of the authentication appears in a variety of ways — the address bar or part of the URL may be green (or any other colour depending on your browser) or there will be a padlock symbol next to the address or in some other part of the address bar. 
        </p>
        <h4>Your Password</h4>
        <p>
          Have a strong password that is unique to each website; you should make sure you have strong passwords for all your different Internet accounts, not just your Volo account. We provide for a 12 character password which means much greater inherent security
        </p>
        <p>
          Your lockbox utilises a pass-phrase mechanism in conjunction with multiple layers of encryption.
        </p>
        <h4>Anti-virus software</h4>
        <p>
          You can protect your computer’s hardware and software from internet threats like malware, which includes computer viruses, spyware, trojans, and rootkits, by installing and maintaining reliable and reputable anti-virus (AV) software. 
        </p>
        <p>
          These Internet threats often infect computers through compromised websites, email attachments, and affected files from attached devices such as a USB sticks and then corrupt and delete data on your computer and/or use your email account to infect other computers by sending illegal spam emails. To help keep your computer virus-free, make sure that your AV software is configured to automatically update everyday
        </p>
        <h4 id='third-party-policy'>Third Party Privacy</h4>
        <p>
          For some of our promotions we measure and target using third party services.  These services may use cookies, images or web beacons and similar technology to collect and receive information from our website and/or others.

        </p>
        <h4>Access to your Information</h4>
        <p>
          Under the Privacy Act 1993 you are entitled to request access to the personal information we hold about you. There are some circumstances under the Act where we may choose not to provide you with some or all of the personal information we hold about you. If that occurs we will write to you and tell you why we have reached that decision.
        </p>
        <h4>Amendments to this Policy</h4>
        <p>
          Over time, as we grow and develop, so may our products, services, and how we do business with you. Please take the time to review this Policy regularly as we may review it and make changes to reflect changes in legislation, codes of practice, our business, and the products we provide to you.
        </p>
